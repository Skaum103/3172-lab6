            <p>
                In a small bowl, mix together soy sauce, oyster sauce, honey, and Sriracha sauce. Set aside.
                Heat vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high heat.
                Add sliced chicken to the hot oil and stir-fry until browned and cooked through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
                Remove the cooked chicken from the wok and set aside.
                In the same wok, add a bit more oil if needed. Stir in garlic and ginger, and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant.
                Add the sliced red and yellow bell peppers, snap peas, and red onion to the wok. Stir-fry the vegetables until they are crisp-tender.
                Return the cooked chicken to the wok and add the diced mango. Stir to combine.
                Pour the sauce mixture over the chicken and vegetables. Toss everything together until well-coated and heated through.
                Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.
                Serve the spicy mango chicken stir-fry over cooked rice or noodles.
                Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds before serving.
